# `list-transformer`

This library provides a "`ListT` done right implementation" that obeys the
`Monad` laws.

Here is an example of how you build and consume `ListT` values:

```haskell
import List.Transformer

import qualified System.IO

stdin :: ListT IO String
stdin = ListT (do
    eof <- System.IO.isEOF
    if eof
        then return Nil
        else do
            string <- getLine
            return (Cons string stdin) )

stdout :: ListT IO String -> IO ()
stdout strings = do
    s <- next strings
    case s of
        Nil                  -> return ()
        Cons string strings' -> do
            putStrLn string
            stdout strings'

main :: IO ()
main = stdout stdin
```

... and here's an example use of this library to print every natural number
using a style resembling list comprehensions:

```haskell
import List.Transformer

main :: IO ()
main = runListT (do
    n <- select [0..]
    liftIO (print n) )
```

To learn more, read the
[tutorial](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/list-transformer/docs/List-Transformer.html).

## Quick start

Install [the `stack` tool](http://haskellstack.org/) and then run:

```bash
$ stack setup
$ stack ghci list-transformer
Prelude> import List.Transformer
Prelude List.Transformer> runListT (do n <- select [0..]; liftIO (print n) )
0
1
2
3
...
```

## Development Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriella439/Haskell-List-Transformer-Library.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriella439/Haskell-List-Transformer-Library)

This library is pretty small so I don't expect there to be breaking changes
since there's not that much that could possibly change.
